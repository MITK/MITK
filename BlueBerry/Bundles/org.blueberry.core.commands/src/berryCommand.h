/**
 * <p>
 * A command is an abstract representation for some semantic behaviour. It is
 * not the actual implementation of this behaviour, nor is it the visual
 * appearance of this behaviour in the user interface. Instead, it is a bridge
 * between the two.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The concept of a command is based on the command design pattern. The notable
 * difference is how the command delegates responsibility for execution. Rather
 * than allowing concrete subclasses, it uses a handler mechanism (see the
 * <code>handlers</code> extension point). This provides another level of
 * indirection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A command will exist in two states: defined and undefined. A command is
 * defined if it is declared in the XML of a resolved plug-in. If the plug-in is
 * unloaded or the command is simply not declared, then it is undefined. Trying
 * to reference an undefined command will succeed, but trying to access any of
 * its functionality will fail with a <code>NotDefinedException</code>. If
 * you need to know when a command changes from defined to undefined (or vice
 * versa), then attach a command listener.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Commands are mutable and will change as their definition changes.
 * </p>
