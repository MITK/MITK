 * The job manager provides facilities for scheduling, querying, and maintaining jobs

 * <ul>
 * <li>Maintains a queue of jobs that are waiting to be run.  Items can be added to
 * the queue using the <code>schedule</code> method.</li>
 * <li> @todo Allows manipulation of groups of jobs called job families. }  Job families can
 * be canceled, put to sleep, or woken up atomically.  There is also a mechanism
 * for querying the set of known jobs in a given family.> </li>
 *
 * <li>Allows listeners to find out about progress on running jobs, and to find out
 * when jobs have changed states.</li>
 * <li> @todo Provides a factory for creating lock objects.  Lock objects are smart monitors
 * that have strategies for avoiding deadlock. ></li>
 *
 * <li>Provide feedback to a client that is waiting for a given job or family of jobs
 * to complete.</li>
