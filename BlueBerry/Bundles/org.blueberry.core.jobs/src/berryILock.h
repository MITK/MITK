/**
 * A lock is used to control access to an exclusive resource.
 * <p>
 * Locks are reentrant.  That is, they can be acquired multiple times by the same thread
 * without releasing.  Locks are only released when the number of successful acquires
 * equals the number of successful releases.
 * </p><p>
 * Locks are capable of detecting and recovering from programming errors that cause
 * circular waiting deadlocks. When a deadlock between two or more <tt>ILock</tt>
 * instances is detected, detailed debugging information is printed to the log file.  The
 * locks will then automatically recover from the deadlock by employing a release
 * and wait strategy. One thread will lose control of the locks it owns, thus breaking
 * the deadlock and  allowing other threads to proceed.  Once that thread's locks are
 * all available, it will be given exclusive access to all its locks and allowed to proceed.
 * A thread can only lose locks while it is waiting on an <tt>acquire()</tt> call.
 *
 * </p><p>
 * Successive acquire attempts by different threads are queued and serviced on
 * a first come, first served basis.
 * </p><p>
 * It is very important that acquired locks eventually get released.  Calls to release
 * should be done in a finally block to ensure they execute.  For example:
 * <pre>
 * try {
 *   lock.acquire();
 *   // ... do work here ...
 * } finally {
 *   lock.release();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Note: although <tt>lock.acquire</tt> should never fail, it is good practice to place
 * it inside the try block anyway.  Releasing without acquiring is far less catastrophic
 * than acquiring without releasing.
 * </p>
