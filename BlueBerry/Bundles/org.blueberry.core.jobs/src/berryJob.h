/**
 * Jobs are units of runnable work that can be scheduled to be run with the job
 * manager.  Once a job has completed, it can be scheduled to run again (jobs are
 * reusable).
 * <p>
 * Jobs have a state that indicates what they are currently doing.  When constructed,
 * jobs start with a state value of <code>NONE</code>.  When a job is scheduled
 * to be run, it moves into the <code>WAITING</code> state.  When a job starts
 * running, it moves into the <code>RUNNING</code> state.  When execution finishes
 * (either normally or through cancellation), the state changes back to
 * <code>NONE</code>.
 * </p><p>
 * A job can also be in the <code>SLEEPING</code> state.  This happens if a user
 * calls Job.sleep() on a waiting job, or if a job is scheduled to run after a specified
 * delay.  Only jobs in the <code>WAITING</code> state can be put to sleep.
 * Sleeping jobs can be woken at any time using Job.wakeUp(), which will put the
 * job back into the <code>WAITING</code> state.
 * </p><p>
 * Jobs can be assigned a priority that is used as a hint about how the job should
 * be scheduled.  There is no guarantee that jobs of one priority will be run before
 * all jobs of lower priority.  The documentation of the various priority constants provide
 * more detail about what each priority means.  By default, jobs start in the
 * <code>LONG</code> priority class.
