/**
 * An adapter manager maintains a registry of adapter factories. Clients
 * directly invoke methods on an adapter manager to register and unregister
 * adapters. All adaptable objects (that is, objects that implement the <code>IAdaptable</code>
 * interface) tunnel <code>IAdaptable.getAdapter</code> invocations to their
 * adapter manager's <code>IAdapterManger.getAdapter</code> method. The
 * adapter manager then forwards this request unmodified to the <code>IAdapterFactory.getAdapter</code>
 * method on one of the registered adapter factories.
 * <p>
 * Adapter factories can be registered programmatically using the <code>registerAdapters</code>
 * method.  Alternatively, they can be registered declaratively using the
 * <code>org.blueberry.core.runtime.adapters</code> extension point.  Factories registered
 * with this extension point will not be able to provide adapters until their
 * corresponding plugin has been activated.
 * <p>
 * The following code snippet shows how one might register an adapter of type
 * <code>com.example.acme.Sticky</code> on resources in the workspace.
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *  IAdapterFactory pr = new IAdapterFactory() {
 *    public Class[] getAdapterList() {
 *      return new Class[] { com.example.acme.Sticky.class };
 *    }
 *    public Object getAdapter(Object adaptableObject, Class adapterType) {
 *      IResource res = (IResource) adaptableObject;
 *      QualifiedName key = new QualifiedName(&quot;com.example.acme&quot;, &quot;sticky-note&quot;);
 *      try {
 *        com.example.acme.Sticky v = (com.example.acme.Sticky) res.getSessionProperty(key);
 *        if (v == null) {
 *          v = new com.example.acme.Sticky();
 *          res.setSessionProperty(key, v);
 *        }
 *      } catch (CoreException e) {
 *        // unable to access session property - ignore
 *      }
 *      return v;
 *    }
 *  }
 *  Platform.getAdapterManager().registerAdapters(pr, IResource.class);
 *   </pre>
 *
 * </p><p>
 * This interface can be used without OSGi running.
 * </p><p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
