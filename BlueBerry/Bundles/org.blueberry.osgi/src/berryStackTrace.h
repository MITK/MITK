 *
 * Purpose:
 *  To generate a stacktrace of a program.
 *
 * Description:
 *  If a debugger is located on the machine we will try this first,
 *  as it usually give better information than built-in methods.
 *  The debugger needs the name of the program to be able to attach
 *  to it, so this must be passed to StackTraceInit(). The second
 *  argument is a filedescriptor that StackTrace() writes to. If this
 *  argument is -1 then standard output will be used.
 *
 * Compilation:
 *  Some platforms have a built-in method to generate stacktraces, but
 *  they are usually located in some non-standard library. The following
 *  are supported:
 *
 *   IRIX    Compile with -DUSE_BUILTIN and -lexc
 *   HP/UX   Compile with -DUSE_BUILTIN and -lcl
 *   GCC     Compile with -DUSE_BUILTIN
