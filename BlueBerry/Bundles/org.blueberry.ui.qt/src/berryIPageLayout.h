 * \ingroup org_blueberry_ui_qt
 *
 * A page layout defines the initial layout for a perspective within a page
 * in a workbench window.
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a perspective is opened, it creates a new page layout with a single editor area.
 * This layout is then passed to the perspective factory (implementation of
 * {@link org.blueberry.ui.IPerspectiveFactory#createInitialLayout(IPageLayout)}) where
 * additional views and other content can be added, using the existing editor area as
 * the initial point of reference.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In some cases, multiple instances of a particular view may need to be added
 * to the same layout.  These are disambiguated using a secondary id.
 * In layout methods taking a view id, the id can have the compound form:
 * <strong>primaryId [':' secondaryId]</strong>.
 * If a secondary id is given, the view must allow multiple instances by
 * having specified <code>allowMultiple="true"</code> in its extension.
 * View placeholders may also have a secondary id.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Wildcards are permitted in placeholder ids (but not regular view ids).
 * '*' matches any substring, '?' matches any single character.
 * Wildcards can be specified for the primary id, the secondary id, or both.
 * For example, the placeholder "someView:*" will match any occurrence of the view
 * that has primary id "someView" and that also has some non-null secondary id.
 * Note that this placeholder will not match the view if it has no secondary id,
 * since the compound id in this case is simply "someView".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example of populating a layout with standard workbench views:
 * <pre>
 * IPageLayout layout = ...
 * // Get the editor area.
 * String editorArea = layout.getEditorArea();
 *
 * // Top left: Resource Navigator view and Bookmarks view placeholder
 * IFolderLayout topLeft = layout.createFolder("topLeft", IPageLayout.LEFT, 0.25f,
 *    editorArea);
 * topLeft.addView(IPageLayout.ID_RES_NAV);
 * topLeft.addPlaceholder(IPageLayout.ID_BOOKMARKS);
 *
 * // Bottom left: Outline view and Property Sheet view
 * IFolderLayout bottomLeft = layout.createFolder("bottomLeft", IPageLayout.BOTTOM, 0.50f,
 *     "topLeft");
 * bottomLeft.addView(IPageLayout.ID_OUTLINE);
 * bottomLeft.addView(IPageLayout.ID_PROP_SHEET);
 *
 * // Bottom right: Task List view
 * layout.addView(IPageLayout.ID_TASK_LIST, IPageLayout.BOTTOM, 0.66f, editorArea);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
