 *
 * A perspective descriptor describes a perspective in an
 * <code>IPerspectiveRegistry</code>.
 * <p>
 * A perspective is a template for view visibility, layout, and action visibility
 * within a workbench page. There are two types of perspective: a predefined
 * perspective and a custom perspective.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A predefined perspective is defined by an extension to the workbench's
 *     perspective extension point (<code>"org.blueberry.ui.perspectives"</code>).
 *     The extension defines a id, label, and <code>IPerspectiveFactory</code>.
 *     A perspective factory is used to define the initial layout for a page.
 *     </li>
 *   <li>A custom perspective is defined by the user.  In this case a predefined
 *     perspective is modified to suit a particular task and saved as a new
 *     perspective.  The attributes for the perspective are stored in a separate file
 *     in the workbench's metadata directory.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Within a page the user can open any of the perspectives known
 * to the workbench's perspective registry, typically by selecting one from the
 * workbench's <code>Open Perspective</code> menu. When selected, the views
 * and actions within the active page rearrange to reflect the perspective.
 * </p>
