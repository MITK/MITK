 * This represents an object that can supply trim around a IPresentablePart.
 * Clients can implement subclasses to provide the appearance for editor workbooks,
 * view folders, fast views, and detached windows.
 * <p>
 * StackPresentations do not store any persistent state and cannot
 * directly make changes to the workbench. They are given an IStackPresentationSite
 * reference on creation, which allows them to send events and requests to the workbench.
 * However, the workbench is free to ignore these requests. The workbench will call one
 * of the public methods on StackPresentation when (and if) the presentation is expected to
 * change state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if the user clicks a button that is intended to close a part, the
 * StackPresentation will send a close request to its site, but should not assume
 * that the part has been closed until the workbench responds with a call
 * <code>StackPresentation.remove</code>.
