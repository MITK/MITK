/**
 * \ingroup org_blueberry_ui
 *
 * An editor is a visual component within a workbench page. It is
 * typically used to edit or browse a document or input object. The input
 * is identified using an <code>IEditorInput</code>.  Modifications made
 * in an editor part follow an open-save-close lifecycle model (in contrast
 * to a view part, where modifications are saved to the workbench
 * immediately).
 * <p>
 * An editor is document or input-centric.  Each editor has an input, and only
 * one editor can exist for each editor input within a page.  This policy has
 * been designed to simplify part management.
 * </p><p>
 * An editor should be used in place of a view whenever more than one instance
 * of a document type can exist.
 * </p><p>
 * This interface may be implemented directly.  For convenience, a base
 * implementation is defined in <code>EditorPart</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An editor part is added to the workbench in two stages:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>An editor extension is contributed to the workbench registry. This
 *    extension defines the extension id, extension class, and the file
 *    extensions which are supported by the editor.</li>
 *  <li>An editor part based upon the extension is created and added to the
 *    workbench when the user opens a file with one of the supported file
 *    extensions (or some other suitable form of editor input).</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All editor parts implement the <code>IAdaptable</code> interface; extensions
 * are managed by the platform's adapter manager.
 * </p>
