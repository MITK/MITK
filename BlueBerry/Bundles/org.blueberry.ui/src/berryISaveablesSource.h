/**
 * Represents a source of Saveable objects (units of saveability). Workbench
 * parts that show more than one unit of saveability, or whose units of
 * saveability change over time, should implement this interface in order to
 * provide better integration with workbench facilities like the Save command,
 * prompts to save on part close or shutdown, etc.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: As of 3.2, implementers of <code>ISaveablesSource</code> must
 * satisfy the following conditions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If ISaveablesSource is implemented by an IWorkbenchPart:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the part must implement <code>ISaveablePart</code></li>
 * <li>if any of its Saveable objects are dirty, the part must return
 * <code>true</code> from {@link ISaveablePart#isDirty()}</li>
 * <li>the part must return <code>true</code> from
 * {@link ISaveablePart#isSaveOnCloseNeeded()} if it is dirty (the default
 * behaviour implemented by {@link EditorPart})</li>
 * <li>the part must not implement {@link ISaveablePart2}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>If ISaveablesSource is implemented by a non-part (possible as of 3.2.1 and 3.3):
 * <ul>
 * <li>the Workbench's {@link ISaveablesLifecycleListener} (obtained from the
 * Workbench by calling
 * <code>workbench.getService(ISaveablesLifecycleListener.class)</code>) must
 * be notified of any change to the result of {@link #getSaveables()} </li>
 * <li>getActiveSaveables() should be implemented to return an empty array
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * If any of these conditions are not met, it is undefined whether the Workbench
 * will prompt to save dirty Saveables when closing parts or the Workbench.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These conditions may be relaxed in future releases.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 3.2
