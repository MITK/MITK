/**
 * \ingroup org_blueberry_ui
 *
 * A view is a visual component within a workbench page. It is typically used to
 * navigate a hierarchy of information (like the workspace), open an editor, or
 * display properties for the active editor. Modifications made in a view are
 * saved immediately (in contrast to an editor part, which conforms to a more
 * elaborate open-save-close lifecycle).
 * <p>
 * Only one instance of a particular view type may exist within a workbench
 * page. This policy is designed to simplify part management for a user.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface may be implemented directly. For convenience, a base
 * implementation is defined in <code>ViewPart</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A view is added to the workbench in two steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A view extension is contributed to the workbench registry. This
 * extension defines the extension id and extension class.</li>
 * <li>The view is included in the default layout for a perspective.
 * Alternatively, the user may open the view from the Perspective menu.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Views implement the <code>IAdaptable</code> interface; extensions are
 * managed by the platform's adapter manager.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As of 3.4, views may optionally adapt to {@link ISizeProvider} if they have
 * a preferred size. The default presentation will make a best effort to
 * allocate the preferred size to a view if it is the only part in a stack. If
 * there is more than one part in the stack, the constraints will be disabled
 * for that stack. The size constraints are adjusted for the size of the tab and
 * border trim. Note that this is considered to be a hint to the presentation,
 * and not all presentations may honor size constraints.
 * </p>
