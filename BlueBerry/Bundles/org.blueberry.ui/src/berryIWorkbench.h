/**
 * \ingroup org_blueberry_ui
 *
 * A workbench is the root object for the BlueBerry Platform user interface.
 * <p>
 * A <b>workbench</b> has one or more main windows which present to the end
 * user information based on some underlying model, typically on resources in an
 * underlying workspace. A workbench usually starts with a single open window,
 * and automatically closes when its last window closes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each <b>workbench window</b> has a collection of <b>pages</b>; the active
 * page is the one that is being presented to the end user; at most one page is
 * active in a window at a time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each workbench page has a collection of <b>workbench parts</b>, of which
 * there are two kinds: views and editors. A page's parts are arranged (tiled or
 * stacked) for presentation on the screen. The arrangement is not fixed; the
 * user can arrange the parts as they see fit. A <b>perspective</b> is a
 * template for a page, capturing a collection of parts and their arrangement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The platform creates a workbench when the workbench plug-in is activated;
 * since this happens at most once during the life of the running platform,
 * there is only one workbench instance. Due to its singular nature, it is
 * commonly referred to as <it>the</it> workbench.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The workbench supports a few {@link IServiceLocator services} by default. If
 * these services are used to allocate resources, it is important to remember to
 * clean up those resources after you are done with them. Otherwise, the
 * resources will exist until the workbench shuts down. The supported services
 * are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link IBindingService}</li>
 * <li>{@link ICommandService}</li>
 * <li>{@link IContextService}</li>
 * <li>{@link IHandlerService}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see PlatformUI#getWorkbench
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
