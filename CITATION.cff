  The Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK) is a free
  open-source software for the development of interactive
  medical image processing software. Based on MITK, we
  provide the MITK Workbench, a powerful and free
  application to view, process, and segment medical images,
  as well as a set of useful commandline applications for
  typical image processing tasks like image registration,
  conversion, stitching.
