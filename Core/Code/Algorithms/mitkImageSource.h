   * @brief Get the output data of this image source object.
   *
   * The output of this
   * function is not valid until an appropriate Update() method has
   * been called, either explicitly or implicitly.  Both the filter
   * itself and the data object have Update() methods, and both
   * methods update the data.  Here are three ways to use
   * GetOutput() and make sure the data is valid.  In these
   * examples, \a image is a pointer to some Image object, and the
   * particular ProcessObjects involved are filters.  The same
   * examples apply to non-image (e.g. Mesh) data as well.
   *
   * \code
   *   anotherFilter->SetInput( someFilter->GetOutput() );
   *   anotherFilter->Update();
   * \endcode
   *
   * In this situation, \a someFilter and \a anotherFilter are said
   * to constitute a \b pipeline.
   *
   * \code
   *   image = someFilter->GetOutput();
   *   image->Update();
   * \endcode
   *
   * \code
   *   someFilter->Update();
   *   image = someFilter->GetOutput();
   * \endcode
   * (In the above example, the two lines of code can be in
   * either order.)
   *
   * Note that Update() is not called automatically except within a
   * pipeline as in the first example.  When \b streaming (using a
   * StreamingImageFilter) is activated, it may be more efficient to
   * use a pipeline than to call Update() once for each filter in
   * turn.
   *
   * For an image, the data generated is for the requested
   * Region, which can be set using ImageBase::SetRequestedRegion().
   * By default, the largest possible region is requested.
   *
   * For Filters which have multiple outputs of different types, the
   * GetOutput() method assumes the output is of OutputImageType. For
   * the GetOutput(DataObjectPointerArraySizeType) method, a dynamic_cast is performed
   * incase the filter has outputs of different types or image
   * types. Derived classes should have named get methods for these
   * outputs.
