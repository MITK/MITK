    Base class for properties. Properties are arbitrary additional information
    (to define a new type of information you have to define a subclass of
    BaseProperty) that can be added to a PropertyList.
    Concrete subclasses of BaseProperty should define Set-/Get-methods to assess
    the property value, which should be stored by value (not by reference).
    Subclasses must implement an operator==(const BaseProperty& property), which
    is used by PropertyList to check whether a property has been changed.
