/**
 * \brief Describes the geometry of a two-dimensional object
 *
 * Describes a two-dimensional manifold, i.e., to put it simply,
 * an object that can be described using a 2D coordinate-system.
 *
 * Geometry2D can map points between 3D world coordinates
 * (in mm) and the described 2D coordinate-system (in mm) by first projecting
 * the 3D point onto the 2D manifold and then calculating the 2D-coordinates
 * (in mm). These 2D-mm-coordinates can be further converted into
 * 2D-unit-coordinates (e.g., pixels), giving a parameter representation of
 * the object with parameter values inside a rectangle
 * (e.g., [0,0]..[width, height]), which is the bounding box (bounding range
 * in z-direction always [0]..[1]).
 *
 * A Geometry2D describes the 2D representation within a 3D object and is
 * therefore itself a Geometry3D (derived from Geometry3D). For example,
 * a single CT-image (slice) is 2D in the sense that you can access the
 * pixels using 2D-coordinates, but is also 3D, as the pixels are really
 * voxels, thus have an extension (thickness) in the 3rd dimension.
 *
 * Most often, instances of Geometry2D will be used to descibe a plane,
 * which is represented by the sub-class PlaneGeometry, but curved
 * surfaces are also possible.
 *
 * Optionally, a reference Geometry3D can be specified, which usually would
 * be the geometry associated with the underlying dataset. This is currently
 * used for calculating the intersection of inclined / rotated planes
 * (represented as Geometry2D) with the bounding box of the associated
 * Geometry3D.
 *
 * \warning The Geometry2Ds are not necessarily up-to-date and not even
 * initialized. As described in the previous paragraph, one of the
 * Generate-/Copy-/UpdateOutputInformation methods have to initialize it.
 * mitk::BaseData::GetGeometry2D() makes sure, that the Geometry2D is
 * up-to-date before returning it (by setting the update extent appropriately
 * and calling UpdateOutputInformation).
 *
 * Rule: everything is in mm (or ms for temporal information) if not
 * stated otherwise.
