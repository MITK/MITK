 *
 * \brief A utility class to load and save data from/to the local file system.
 *
 * This method LoadFiles queries the MITK Micro Services registry for registered mitk::IDataNodeReader service
 * instances. The service instance with the highest ranking will be asked first to load the
 * given file. On error (exception thrown) or if no mitk::DataNode was constructed, the next
 * service instance is used.
 *
 * The methods LoadImage, LoadSurface, and LoadPointSet are convenience methods for general loading of
 * the three main data types in MITK. They all use the more generic method LoadDataNode.
 *
 * The methods SaveImage, SaveSurface, and SurfacePointSet are also meant for convenience (e.g. during testing).
 * Currently, there is no generic way to save a generic DataNode with an appropriate format. Thus, every method
 * initializes the corresponding instance of the special writer for the data type.
 *
 * \see mitk::IDataNodeReader
