    This method appends several standard locations to the end of the searchqueue (if they not already exist)
    and then searches for the file within all directories contained in the search queue:

    <ol>
      <li> Add the directory specified in the environment variable MITKCONF
      <li> Add the .mitk directory in the home folder of the user
      <li> Add the current working directory
      <li> Add the (current working directory)/bin directory
      <li> Add the directory specified in pathInSourceDir, that is relative to the source code directory root (which is determined at compile time)
    </ol>

  Already added directories in the searchqueue by using AddDirectoryForSearch before calling FindFile are still searched first,
    because above mentioned standard locations are always appended at the end of the list.
