  /** \brief Mapper to resample and display 2D slices of a 3D image.
 * 
 * The following image gives a brief overview of the mapping and the involved parts.
 *
 * \image html imageVtkMapper2Darchitecture.png
 *
 * First, the image is resliced by means of vtkImageReslice. The volume image
 * serves as input to the mapper in addition to spatial placement of the slice and a few other
 * properties such as thick slices. This code was already present in the old version
 * (mitkImageMapperGL2D).
 *
 * Next, the obtained slice (m_ReslicedImage) is used to create a texture
 * (m_Texture) and a plane onto which the texture is rendered (m_Plane). For
 * mapping purposes, a vtkPolyDataMapper (m_Mapper) is utilized. Orthographic
 * projection is applied to create the effect of a 2D image. The mapper and the
 * texture are assigned to the actor (m_Actor) which is passed to the VTK rendering
 * pipeline via the method GetVtkProp().
 *
 * In order to transform the textured plane to the correct position in space, the
 * same transformation as used for reslicing is applied to both the camera and the
 * vtkActor. All important steps are explained in more detail below. The resulting
 * 2D image (by reslicing the underlying 3D input image appropriately) can either
 * be directly rendered in a 2D view or just be calculated to be used later by another
 * rendering entity, e.g. in texture mapping in a 3D view.
 *
 * Properties that can be set for images and influence the imageMapper2D are:
 *
 *   - \b "opacity": (FloatProperty) Opacity of the image
 *   - \b "black opacity": (FloatProperty) The opacity of black (first index in lookup tables)
 *   - \b "color": (ColorProperty) Color of the image
 *   - \b "use color": (BoolProperty) Use the color of the image or not
 *   - \b "binary": (BoolProperty) is the image a binary image or not
 *   - \b "outline binary": (BoolProperty) show outline of the image or not
 *   - \b "texture interpolation": (BoolProperty) texture interpolation of the image
 *   - \b "reslice interpolation": (VtkResliceInterpolationProperty) reslice interpolation of the image
 *   - \b "in plane resample extent by geometry": (BoolProperty) Do it or not
 *   - \b "bounding box": (BoolProperty) Is the Bounding Box of the image shown or not
 *   - \b "layer": (IntProperty) Layer of the image
 *   - \b "volume annotation color": (ColorProperty) color of the volume annotation, TODO has to be reimplemented
 *   - \b "volume annotation unit": (StringProperty) annotation unit as string (does not implicit convert the unit!) 
          unit is ml or cm3, TODO has to be reimplemented

 * The default properties are:

 *   - \b "opacity", mitk::FloatProperty::New(0.3f), renderer, overwrite )
 *   - \b "black opacity", mitk::FloatProperty::New(0.0f), renderer, overwrite )
 *   - \b "color", ColorProperty::New(1.0,0.0,0.0), renderer, overwrite )
 *   - \b "use color", mitk::BoolProperty::New( true ), renderer, overwrite )
 *   - \b "binary", mitk::BoolProperty::New( true ), renderer, overwrite )
 *   - \b "outline binary", mitk::BoolProperty::New( false ), renderer, overwrite )
 *   - \b "texture interpolation", mitk::BoolProperty::New( mitk::DataNodeFactory::m_TextureInterpolationActive ) )
 *   - \b "reslice interpolation", mitk::VtkResliceInterpolationProperty::New() )
 *   - \b "in plane resample extent by geometry", mitk::BoolProperty::New( false ) )
 *   - \b "bounding box", mitk::BoolProperty::New( false ) )
 *   - \b "layer", mitk::IntProperty::New(10), renderer, overwrite)

 * If the modality-property is set for an image, the mapper uses modality-specific default properties,
 * e.g. color maps, if they are defined.
