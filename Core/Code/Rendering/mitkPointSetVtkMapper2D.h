  /**
  * @brief Vtk-based 2D mapper for PointSet
  *
  * Due to the need of different colors for selected
  * and unselected points and the facts, that we also have a contour and
  * labels for the points, the vtk structure is build up the following way:
  *
  * We have three PolyData, one selected, and one unselected and one
  * for a contour between the points. Each one is connected to an own
  * PolyDataMapper and an Actor. The different color for the unselected and
  * selected state and for the contour is read from properties.
  *
  * This mapper has several additional functionalities, such as rendering
  * a contour between points, calculating and displaying distances or angles
  * between points.
  *
  * Then the three Actors are combined inside a vtkPropAssembly and this
  * object is returned in GetProp() and so hooked up into the rendering
  * pipeline.

  * Properties that can be set for point sets and influence the PointSetVTKMapper2D are:
  *
  *   - \b "line width": (IntProperty 2)                      // line width of the line from one point to another
  *   - \b "point line width": (IntProperty 1)                // line width of the cross marking a point
  *   - \b "point 2D size": (IntProperty 6)                   // size of the glyph marking a point
  *   - \b "show contour": (BoolProperty false)               // enable contour rendering between points (lines)
  *   - \b "close contour": (BoolProperty false)              // if enabled, the open strip is closed (first point connected with last point)
  *   - \b "show points": (BoolProperty true)                 // show or hide points
  *   - \b "show distances": (BoolProperty false)             // show or hide distance measure
  *   - \b "distance decimal digits": (IntProperty 2)         // set the number of decimal digits to be shown when rendering the distance information
  *   - \b "show angles": (BoolProperty false)                // show or hide angle measurement
  *   - \b "show distant lines": (BoolProperty false)         // show the line between to points from a distant view (equals "always on top" option)
  *   - \b "layer": (IntProperty 1)                           // default is drawing pointset above images (they have a default layer of 0)
  *   - \b "PointSet.2D.shape" (EnumerationProperty Cross)    // provides different shapes marking a point
  *       0 = "None", 1 = "Vertex", 2 = "Dash", 3 = "Cross", 4 = "ThickCross", 5 = "Triangle", 6 = "Square", 7 = "Circle",
  *       8 = "Diamond", 9 = "Arrow", 10 = "ThickArrow", 11 = "HookedArrow", 12 = "Cross"
  *   - \b "PointSet.2D.fill shape": (BoolProperty false)     // fill or do not fill the glyph shape
  *   - \b "Pointset.2D.distance to plane": (FloatProperty 4.0) //In the 2D render window, points are rendered which lie within a certain distance
  *                                                             to the current plane. They are projected on the current plane and scalled according to their distance.
  *                                                             Point markers appear smaller as the plane moves away from their true location.
  *                                                             The distance threshold can be adjusted by this float property, which ables the user to delineate the points
  *                                                             that lie exactly on the plane. (+/- rounding error)
  *
  * Other Properties used here but not defined in this class:
  *
  *   - \b "selectedcolor": (ColorProperty (1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f))  // default color of the selected pointset e.g. the current point is red
  *   - \b "contourcolor" : (ColorProperty (1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f))  // default color for the contour is red
  *   - \b "color": (ColorProperty (1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f))          // default color of the (unselected) pointset is yellow
  *   - \b "opacity": (FloatProperty 1.0)                       // opacity of point set, contours
  *   - \b "label": (StringProperty NULL)     // a label can be defined for each point, which is rendered in proximity to the point
  *
