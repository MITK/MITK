\code{.cpp}
!1.132! WARNING: QmitkSliceWidget data is not an image!
!1.150! WARNING: QmitkSliceWidget data is not an image!
\endcode

make sure your working directory is set correctly. This is especially an issue when directly running the application from the IDE. It should be set to:

$MITK_ROOT_DIRECTORY/build/MITK-build/bin </li>
