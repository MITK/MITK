 \page Step05Page MITK Tutorial - Step 5: Interactively add points
 
 In addition to Step 4 where 3 views on the data were created we now want to interactively add points.

 A node containing a PointSet as data is added to the data tree and a PointSetInteractor is associated with the node, which handles the interaction. 
 The @em interaction @em pattern is defined in a state-machine, stored in an external XML file. Thus, we need to load a state-machine.

 The interaction patterns defines the @em events, on which the interactor reacts (e.g., which mouse buttons are used to set a point), the @em transition to the next state (e.g., the initial
 may be "empty point set") and associated @a actions (e.g., add a point at the position where the mouse-click occured).  
 More information about interaction in MITK can be found \ref InteractionPage "here".
 
 In order to add a point the shift key has to be pressed simultaneously to marking the point with the mouse.
 
 \li \ref Step5.cpp "Step5.cpp"\n 
 Contains the code for this step.

 \dontinclude Step5.cpp

 
 A PointSet and a node for it have to be created to be able to interactively add points:
 
 \skipline mitk::PointSet
 \until "pointsetinteractor"
