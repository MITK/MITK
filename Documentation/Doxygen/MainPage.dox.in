\section intro Introduction

Welcome to the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK). 
Currently under active development, MITK aims at supporting the 
development of leading-edge medical imaging software 
with a high degree of interaction. It combines <a href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK</a>, 
<a href="http://www.itk.org">ITK</a> and the pic-based-libraries of the 
<a href="http://mbi.dkfz-heidelberg.de">Div. Medical and Biological Informatics </a> 
of the <a href="http://www.dkfz.de">DKFZ</a> and adds those features that are most important 
for developing interactive medical imaging software covered neither by VTK nor ITK, i.e:
\li multiple, consistent views on the same data. For example, when you have three orthogonal
2D-views and a 3D view and data consisting of a green surface, the surface will be visible and green 
in all views (as contour lines in 2D, as a surface in 3D), and when you move the surface, it will 
move in all views. When you try to realize this with basic VTK, you will need to coordinate the 
position/orientation/color/... of all the views somewhere in your program - exactly this can MITK 
do for you.
\li interactions that create and/or modify data (not only actors as in basic VTK) 
\li complex interactions with multiple states, e.g., for interaction with active contours
\li undo/redo of interactions
\li organization of data objects in a tree at run-time, e.g., to represent logical dependencies (e.g.,
a heart cavity is a part of the heart) or to control the rendering process
\li additional properties of arbitrary type can be assigned to data objects contained in the data tree
\li visualization and interaction with 3D+t data (basic VTK can handle only 3D data and ITK is not 
for visualization and interaction)
\li although MITK is mainly a toolkit and not an application, it offers some support on the 
application-level, e.g, for structured combination of modules (so-called functionalities), e.g., for 
combining and switching between one functionality for segmentation and another for registration.

MITK re-uses virtually anything from VTK and ITK. Thus, it is not at all a competitor to VTK or ITK, but 
an extension, which tries to ease the combination of both and to add the features outlined above.
