It offers:

<li>A button "Take HighDef 3D Screenshot" to take an high resolution screenshot of the 3D scene
<li>A button "Generate Movie" whichs takes a movie of the chosen window by scrolling either through all slices (Axial, Sagittal, Coronal)
or rotating the 3D scene
<li>A selection box where the 3D view can be transformed into either a red-blue stereo or a D4D stereo view
