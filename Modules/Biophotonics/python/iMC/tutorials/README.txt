The tutorials are not fletched out, since I want to discuss the general direction first.
I propose IPhython notebooks, as e.g. Google does for the Caffe framework:
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/00-classification.ipynb

I added a tutorial for the monte carlo spectra generation to show how this could look like.
