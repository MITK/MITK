To execute the python scripts in this folder you will need:

A working executable to gpumcml (e.g. gpumcml.sm_20) somewhere on your computer. You can find gpumcml in
https://code.google.com/p/gpumcml/
Apply patch gpumcml.pathch to gpumcml. This will change the output made by gpumcml slightly to only output things
needed for our simulations.

Python libraries:
pymiecoated
numpy
scipy 0.15
sklearn

Other:
