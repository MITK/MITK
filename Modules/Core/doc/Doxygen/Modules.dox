/**
  \defgroup Core Core
  \ingroup MITKModules

  \brief This category includes classes of the MITK Core module.

  The MITK Core module contains abstractions for common data types and their
  geometries, I/O facilities for loading and saving data in various formats,
  infrastructures for handling user interaction and undo/redo operations,
  GUI toolkit independent visualization classes, and a generic service registry.

  In almost all cases, additional MITK modules will make use of classes contained
  in the Core module.

/**
  \defgroup Data Data Classes
  \ingroup Core

  \brief This subcategory includes the data classes, e.g., for images (mitk::Image),
  surfaces (mitk::Surface), vessel-trees (mitk::VesselTreeData), etc.

  Data access classes are only included, if there is no equivalent in itk (see
  \ref ProcessAndAdaptorClasses "Process and Adaptor Classes" below).

  \defgroup ProcessAdaptor Process and Adaptor Classes
  \ingroup Core

  \brief This category includes process (algorithm) classes developed specifically for mitk and
  (mainly) adaptor classes for the integration of algorithms from other toolkits
  (currently vtk, itk).

  The itk adaptor classes are also useful for data access to mitk data objects.

/**
  \defgroup InteractionUndo Interaction and Undo Classes
  \ingroup Core

  \brief This category includes classes that support the developer to create
  software that allows the user to interact with the data.

  This includes complex interactions that have multiple states (e.g., moving a handle of an
  active contour vs changing its local elasicity) and a concept to realize an undo/redo-mechanism.

  A detailed description of the rationale for these classes can be found in
  \ref InteractionPage.

/**
  \defgroup Interaction Interaction Classes
  \ingroup InteractionUndo

  \brief This subcategory includes interaction classes (subclasses of mitk::StateMachine) that change
  the data according to the input of the user.

  For undo-support, the change is done by sending an OperationEvent to the respective
  data object, which changes itself accordingly.

  A detailed description of the rationale for these classes can be found in
  \ref InteractionPage.

/**
  \defgroup Undo Undo Classes
  \ingroup InteractionUndo

  \brief This subcategory includes the undo/redo-specific classes.

  For undo-support, the change is done by sending an OperationEvent to the respective data object,
  which changes itself accordingly.

  A detailed description of the rationale for these classes can be found in
  \ref InteractionPage.
