  * \brief Organizes geometries over arbitrary defined time steps
  *
  * For this TimeGeometry implementation it is assumed that
  * the durations of the time steps are arbitrary and may differ.
  * The geometries of the time steps are independent,
  * and not linked to each other. Since the timeBounds of the
  * geometries are different for each time step it is not possible
  * to set the same geometry to different time steps. Instead
  * copies should be used.
  * @remark The lower time bound of a succeeding time step may not be smaller
  * than the upper time bound of its predecessor. Thus the list of time points is
  * always sorted by its lower time bounds.
  * @remark For the conversion between time step and time point the following assumption
  * is used.:\n
  * time step -> time point: time point is the lower time bound of the geometry indicated by step.\n
  * time point -> time step: associated time step is last step which lower time bound is smaller or equal then the time
  * point.
