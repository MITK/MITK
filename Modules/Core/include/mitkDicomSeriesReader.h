 \section DicomSeriesReader_purpose Purpose

 DicomSeriesReader serves as a central class for loading DICOM images as mitk::Image.

 As the term "DICOM image" covers a huge variety of possible modalities and
 implementations, and since MITK assumes that 3D images are made up of continuous blocks
 of slices without any gaps or changes in orientation, the loading mechanism must
 implement a number of decisions and compromises.

 <b>The main intention of this implementation is not efficiency but correctness of generated slice positions and pixel spacings!</b>

 \section DicomSeriesReader_limitations Assumptions and limitations

 The class is working only with GDCM 2.0.14 (or possibly newer). This version is the
 default of an MITK super-build. Support for other versions or ITK's DicomIO was dropped
 because of the associated complexity of DicomSeriesReader.

 \b Assumptions
  - expected to work with certain SOP Classes (mostly CT Image Storage and MR Image Storage)
    - see ImageBlockDescriptor.GetReaderImplementationLevel() method for the details
  - special treatment for a certain type of Philips 3D ultrasound (recogized by tag 3001,0010 set to "Philips3D")
  - loader will always attempt to read multiple single slices as a single 3D image volume (i.e. mitk::Image)
    - slices will be grouped by basic properties such as orientation, rows, columns, spacing and grouped into as large blocks as possible
  - images which do NOT report a position or orientation in space (Image Position Patient, Image Orientation) will be assigned defaults
    - image position (0,0,0)
    - image orientation (1,0,0), (0,1,0)
    - such images will always be grouped separately since spatial grouping / sorting makes no sense for them

 \b Options
  - images that cover the same piece of space (i.e. position, orientation, and dimensions are equal)
    can be interpreted as time-steps of the same image, i.e. a series will be loaded as 3D+t

 \b Limitations
  - the 3D+t assumption only works if all time-steps have an equal number of slices and if all
    have the Acquisition Time attribute set to meaningful values

 \section DicomSeriesReader_usage Usage

 The starting point for an application is a set of DICOM files that should be loaded.
 For convenience, DicomSeriesReader can also parse a whole directory for DICOM files,
 but an application should better know exactly what to load.

 Loading is then done in two steps:

  1. <b>Group the files into spatial blocks</b> by calling GetSeries().
     This method will sort all passed files into meaningful blocks that
     could fit into an mitk::Image. Sorting for 3D+t loading is optional but default.
     The \b return value of this function is a list of descriptors, which
     describe a grouped list of files with its most basic properties:
     - SOP Class (CT Image Storage, Secondary Capture Image Storage, etc.)
     - Modality
     - What type of pixel spacing can be read from the provided DICOM tags
     - How well DicomSeriesReader is prepared to load this type of data

  2. <b>Load a sorted set of files</b> by calling LoadDicomSeries().
     This method expects go receive the sorting output of GetSeries().
     The method will then invoke ITK methods configured with GDCM-IO
     classes to actually load the files into memory and put them into
     mitk::Images. Again, loading as 3D+t is optional.

  Example:

\code

 // only a directory is known at this point: /home/who/dicom

 DicomSeriesReader::FileNamesGrouping allImageBlocks = DicomSeriesReader::GetSeries("/home/who/dicom/");

 // file now divided into groups of identical image size, orientation, spacing, etc.
 // each of these lists should be loadable as an mitk::Image.

 DicomSeriesReader::StringContainer seriesToLoad = allImageBlocks[...]; // decide what to load

 // final step: load into DataNode (can result in 3D+t image)
 DataNode::Pointer node = DicomSeriesReader::LoadDicomSeries( oneBlockSorted );

 itk::SmartPointer<Image> image = dynamic_cast<mitk::Image*>( node->GetData() );
\endcode

 \section DicomSeriesReader_sorting Logic for sorting 2D slices from DICOM images into 3D+t blocks for mitk::Image

 The general sorting mechanism (implemented in GetSeries) groups and sorts a set of DICOM files, each assumed to contain a single CT/MR slice.
 In the following we refer to those file groups as "blocks", since this is what they are meant to become when loaded into an mitk::Image.

 \subsection DicomSeriesReader_sorting1 Step 1: Avoiding pure non-sense

 A first pass separates slices that cannot possibly be loaded together because of restrictions of mitk::Image.
 After this steps, each block contains only slices that match in all of the following DICOM tags:

   - (0020,000e) Series Instance UID
   - (0020,0037) Image Orientation
   - (0028,0030) Pixel Spacing
   - (0018,1164) Imager Pixel Spacing
   - (0018,0050) Slice Thickness
   - (0028,0010) Number Of Rows
   - (0028,0011) Number Of Columns
   - (0028,0008) Number Of Frames

 \subsection DicomSeriesReader_sorting2 Step 2: Sort slices spatially

 Before slices are further analyzed, they are sorted spatially. As implemented by GdcmSortFunction(),
 slices are sorted by
   1. distance from origin (calculated using (0020,0032) Image Position Patient and (0020,0037) Image Orientation)
   2. when distance is equal, (0020,0012) Aquisition Number, (0008,0032) Acquisition Time and (0018,1060) Trigger Time are
      used as a backup criterions (necessary for meaningful 3D+t sorting)

 \subsection DicomSeriesReader_sorting3 Step 3: Ensure equal z spacing

 Since inter-slice distance is not recorded in DICOM tags, we must ensure that blocks are made up of
 slices that have equal distances between neighboring slices. This is especially necessary because itk::ImageSeriesReader
 is later used for the actual loading, and this class expects (and does nocht verify) equal inter-slice distance (see \ref DicomSeriesReader_whatweknowaboutitk).

 To achieve such grouping, the inter-slice distance is calculated from the first two different slice positions of a block.
 Following slices are added to a block as long as they can be added by adding the calculated inter-slice distance to the
 last slice of the block. Slices that do not fit into the expected distance pattern, are set aside for further analysis.
 This grouping is done until each file has been assigned to a group.

 Slices that share a position in space are also sorted into separate blocks during this step.
 So the result of this step is a set of blocks that contain only slices with equal z spacing
 and uniqe slices at each position.

 \subsection DicomSeriesReader_sorting4 Step 4 (optional): group 3D blocks as 3D+t when possible

 This last step depends on an option of GetSeries(). When requested, image blocks from the previous step are merged again
 whenever two blocks occupy the same portion of space (i.e. same origin, number of slices and z-spacing).

 \section DicomSeriesReader_gantrytilt Handling of gantry tilt

 When CT gantry tilt is used, the gantry plane (= X-Ray source and detector ring) and the vertical plane do not align
 anymore. This scanner feature is used for example to reduce metal artifacs (e.g. <i>Lee C , Evaluation of Using CT
 Gantry Tilt Scan on Head and Neck Cancer Patients with Dental Structure: Scans Show Less Metal Artifacts. Presented
 at: Radiological Society of North America 2011 Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting; November 27- December 2,
 2011 Chicago IL.</i>).

 The acquired planes of such CT series do not match the expectations of a orthogonal geometry in mitk::Image: if you
 stack the slices, they show a small shift along the Y axis:
\verbatim

  without tilt       with tilt

    ||||||             //////
    ||||||            //////
--  |||||| --------- ////// -------- table orientation
    ||||||          //////
    ||||||         //////

Stacked slices:

  without tilt       with tilt

 --------------    --------------
 --------------     --------------
 --------------      --------------
 --------------       --------------
 --------------        --------------

\endverbatim


 As such gemetries do not in conjunction with mitk::Image, DicomSeriesReader performs a correction for such series
 if the groupImagesWithGantryTilt or correctGantryTilt flag in GetSeries and LoadDicomSeries is set (default = on).

 The correction algorithms undoes two errors introduced by ITK's ImageSeriesReader:
  - the plane shift that is ignored by ITK's reader is recreated by applying a shearing transformation using itk::ResampleFilter.
  - the spacing is corrected (it is calculated by ITK's reader from the distance between two origins, which is NOT the slice distance in this special case)

 Both errors are introduced in
 itkImageSeriesReader.txx (ImageSeriesReader<TOutputImage>::GenerateOutputInformation(void)), lines 176 to 245 (as of ITK 3.20)

 For the correction, we examine two consecutive slices of a series, both described as a pair (origin/orientation):
  - we calculate if the first origin is on a line along the normal of the second slice
    - if this is not the case, the geometry will not fit a normal mitk::Image/mitk::Geometry3D
    - we then project the second origin into the first slice's coordinate system to quantify the shift
    - both is done in class GantryTiltInformation with quite some comments.

 The geometry of image stacks with tilted geometries is illustrated below:
  - green: the DICOM images as described by their tags: origin as a point with the line indicating the orientation
  - red: the output of ITK ImageSeriesReader: wrong, larger spacing, no tilt
  - blue: how much a shear must correct

 \section DicomSeriesReader_whatweknowaboutitk The actual image loading process

 When calling LoadDicomSeries(), this method "mainly" uses an instance of itk::ImageSeriesReader,
 configured with an itk::GDCMImageIO object. Because DicomSeriesReader works around some of the
 behaviors of these classes, the following is a list of features that we find in the code and need to work with:

  - itk::ImageSeriesReader::GenerateOutputInformation() does the z-spacing handling
    + spacing is directly determined by comparing (euclidean distance) the origins of the first two slices of a series
      * this is GOOD because there is no reliable z-spacing information in DICOM images
      * this is bad because it does not work with gantry tilt, in which case the slice distance is SMALLER than the distance between two origins (see section on tilt)
  - origin and spacing are calculated by GDCMImageIO and re-used in itk::ImageSeriesReader
    + the origins are read from appropriate tags, nothing special about that
    + the spacing is read by gdcm::ImageReader, gdcm::ImageHelper::GetSpacingValue() from a tag determined by gdcm::ImageHelper::GetSpacingTagFromMediaStorage(), which basically determines ONE appropriate pixel spacing tag for each media storage type (ct image, mr image, secondary capture image, etc.)
      * this is fine for modalities such as CT/MR where the "Pixel Spacing" tag is mandatory, but for other modalities such as CR or Secondary Capture, the tag "Imager Pixel Spacing" is taken, which is no only optional but also has a more complicated relation with the "Pixel Spacing" tag. For this reason we check/modify the pixel spacing reported by itk::ImageSeriesReader after loading the image (see \ref DicomSeriesReader_pixelspacing)

 AFTER loading, DicomSeriesReader marks some of its findings as mitk::Properties to the loaded Image and DataNode:
  - <b>dicomseriesreader.SOPClass</b> : DICOM SOP Class as readable string (instead of a UID)
  - <b>dicomseriesreader.ReaderImplementationLevelString</b> : Confidence /Support level of the reader for this image as readable string
  - <b>dicomseriesreader.ReaderImplementationLevel</b> : Confidence /Support level of the reader for this image as enum value of type ReaderImplementationLevel
  - <b>dicomseriesreader.PixelSpacingInterpretationString</b> : Appropriate interpreteation of pixel spacing for this Image as readable string
  - <b>dicomseriesreader.PixelSpacingInterpretation</b> : Appropriate interpreteation of pixel spacing for this Image as enum value of type PixelSpacingInterpretation
  - <b>dicomseriesreader.MultiFrameImage</b> : bool flag to mark multi-frame images
  - <b>dicomseriesreader.GantyTiltCorrected</b> : bool flag to mark images where a gantry tilt was corrected to fit slices into an mitk::Image
  - <b>dicomseriesreader.3D+t</b> : bool flag to mark images with a time dimension (multiple 3D blocks of the same size at the same position in space)

 \section DicomSeriesReader_pixelspacing Handling of pixel spacing

 The reader implementes what is described in DICOM Part 3, chapter 10.7 (Basic Pixel Spacing Calibration Macro): Both tags
  - (0028,0030) Pixel Spacing and
  - (0018,1164) Imager Pixel Spacing

 are evaluated and the pixel spacing is set to the spacing within the patient when tags allow that.
 The result of pixel spacing interpretation can be read from a property "dicomseriesreader.PixelSpacingInterpretation",
 which refers to one of the enumerated values of type PixelSpacingInterpretation;

 \section DicomSeriesReader_supportedmodalities Limitations for specific modalities

  - <b>Enhanced Computed Tomography / Magnetic Resonance Images</b> are currently NOT supported at all, because we lack general support for multi-frame images.
  - <b>Nuclear Medicine Images</b> are not supported fully supported, only the single-frame variants are loaded properly.

 \section DicomSeriesReader_nextworkitems Possible enhancements

  This is a short list of ideas for enhancement:
   - Class has historically grown and should be reviewed again. There is probably too many duplicated scanning code
   - Multi-frame images don't mix well with the curent assumption of "one file - one slice", which is assumed by our code
     - It should be checked how well GDCM and ITK support these files (some load, some don't)
   - Specializations such as the Philips 3D code should be handled in a more generic way. The current handling of Philips 3D images is not nice at all

 \section DicomSeriesReader_whynotinitk Why is this not in ITK?

  Some of this code would probably be better located in ITK. It is just a matter of resources that this is not the
  case yet. Any attempts into this direction are welcome and can be supported. At least the gantry tilt correction
  should be a simple addition to itk::ImageSeriesReader.

 \section DicomSeriesReader_tests Tests regarding DICOM loading

 A number of tests have been implemented to check our assumptions regarding DICOM loading. Please see \ref DICOMTesting

 \todo refactor all the protected helper objects/methods into a separate header so we compile faster
