  * @brief Converts pixel data to surface data by using a threshold
  * The mitkImageToSurfaceFilter is used to create a new surface out of an mitk image. The filter
  * uses a threshold to define the surface. It is based on the vtkMarchingCube algorithm. By default
  * a vtkPolyData surface based on an input threshold for the input image will be created. Optional
  * it is possible to reduce the number of triangles/polygones [SetDecimate(mitk::ImageToSurfaceFilter::DecimatePro) and SetTargetReduction (float _arg)]
  * or smooth the surface-data [SetSmooth(true), SetSmoothIteration(int smoothIteration) and SetSmoothRelaxation(float smoothRelaxation)].
  *
  * The resulting vtk-surface has the same size as the input image. The surface
  * can be generally smoothed by vtkDecimatePro reduce complexity of triangles
  * and vtkSmoothPolyDataFilter to relax the mesh. Both are enabled by default
  * and connected in the common way of pipelining in ITK. It's also possible
  * to create time sliced surfaces.
