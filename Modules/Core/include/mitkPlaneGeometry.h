/**
* \brief Describes the geometry of a plane object
*
* Describes a two-dimensional manifold, i.e., to put it simply,
* an object that can be described using a 2D coordinate-system.
*
* PlaneGeometry can map points between 3D world coordinates
* (in mm) and the described 2D coordinate-system (in mm) by first projecting
* the 3D point onto the 2D manifold and then calculating the 2D-coordinates
* (in mm). These 2D-mm-coordinates can be further converted into
* 2D-unit-coordinates (e.g., pixels), giving a parameter representation of
* the object with parameter values inside a rectangle
* (e.g., [0,0]..[width, height]), which is the bounding box (bounding range
* in z-direction always [0]..[1]).
*
* A PlaneGeometry describes the 2D representation within a 3D object (derived from BaseGeometry). For example,
* a single CT-image (slice) is 2D in the sense that you can access the
* pixels using 2D-coordinates, but is also 3D, as the pixels are really
* voxels, thus have an extension (thickness) in the 3rd dimension.
*
*
* Optionally, a reference BaseGeometry can be specified, which usually would
* be the geometry associated with the underlying dataset. This is currently
* used for calculating the intersection of inclined / rotated planes
* (represented as PlaneGeometry) with the bounding box of the associated
* BaseGeometry.
*
* \warning The PlaneGeometry are not necessarily up-to-date and not even
* initialized. As described in the previous paragraph, one of the
* Generate-/Copy-/UpdateOutputInformation methods have to initialize it.
* mitk::BaseData::GetPlaneGeometry() makes sure, that the PlaneGeometry is
* up-to-date before returning it (by setting the update extent appropriately
* and calling UpdateOutputInformation).
*
* Rule: everything is in mm (or ms for temporal information) if not
* stated otherwise.
