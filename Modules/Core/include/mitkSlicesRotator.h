  \brief Coordinates rotation of multiple visible rendering planes (represented as lines in other render windows).
  \ingroup NavigationControl

  This class takes care of several SliceNavigationControllers and handles slice selection
  / slice rotation. It is added as listener to GlobalInteraction by QmitkStdMultiWidget.

  The SlicesRotator class adds the possibility of slice rotation to the "normal" behaviour
  of SliceNavigationControllers (which is picking one plane from a stack of planes).

  This additional class SlicesRotator is needed, because one has to be aware of multiple
  "visible slices" (selected PlaneGeometries of some SliceNavigationControllers) in order to
  choose between rotation and slice selection. Such functionality could not be implemented
  by a single SliceNavigationController.

  Rotation is achieved by modifying (rotating) the generated TimeGeometry of the
  corresponding SliceNavigationControllers.

  \section mitkSlicesRotator_StandardCase The standard case: three orthogonal views (MPR)

  With SlicesRotator, the rule to choose between slice rotation and selection is simple:
  For a mouse down event, count the number of visible planes, which are "near" the cursor.
  If this number is 2 (one for the window, which currently holds the cursor, one for the
  intersection line of another visible slice), then initiate rotation, else select slices
  near the cursor. If the "LinkPlanes" flag is set, the rotation is applied to the planes
  of all registered SNCs, not only of the one associated with the directly selected plane.

  In contrast to the situation without the SlicesRotator, the SliceNavigationControllers
  are now NOT directly registered as listeners to GlobalInteraction. SlicesRotator is
  registered as a listener and decides whether something should be rotated or whether
  another slice should be selected. In the latter case, a PositionEvent is just forwarded
  to the SliceNavigationController.

  \section mitkSlicesRotator_GeneralizedCase The generalized case: any number of views

  Above section as well as the original implementation of this class assumes that we have
  exactly three 2D vies in our scene. This used to be the standard setup of the MITK
  associated application for a long time.  With custom applications based on MITK it is
  easy to create different situations.  One usual use case would be to have one extra
  render window display the contents of any of the other ones and behave exactly like it
  (could e.g. be used on a second screen).

  In this situation the above assumption "we rotate when there are exactly 2 slices close
  to the cursor" will not hold: since we always have two render windows displaying the
  exact same slice, the number of 2 is the minimum we get. Whenever the user clicks in one
  of those windows and the cursor is close to one of the orthogonal planes, we will get a
  count of 3 or more planes that are "close to the cursor".

  For the class to behave correctly, we actually need to distinguish three separate cases:
   1. the cursor is not close to any orthogonal planes. This should result in slice selection.
   2. the cursor is close to just one orthogonal plane OR multiple which are not distinguishable visually. This should result in rotation.
   3. the cursor is close to multiple orthogonal planes which are rendered as distinguishable lines on the render window. This is the case when we hit the crosshair-center of the view. In this case, we need to also just select slices.

   \section mitkSlicesRotator_Solution Deciding between slice selection and rotation

   The "counting nearby lines in the renderwindow" can also work for the general case
   described above.  Only one details needs to be accounted for: we must not count a line
   when it is identical to another line. I.e. we just count how many visible lines on the
   screen are very close to the cursor. When this number is 1, we rotate, otherwise we let
   the SliceNavigationControllers do their slice selection job.
