/**
* \brief Implements the handling of events that are missing for MITK interaction.
*
* This class inherits from vtkInteractorStyleUser, a class that handles
* VTK-Events and invokes callbacks by means of an observer pattern.
*
* Most event-types needed for typical MITK interaction have already
* been implemented in vtkInteractorStyleUser (Mouse-Buttons + Keyboard).
* However, wheel-events and widgetModifed-events (whatever these are)
* have not been handled so far. This is the purpose of this class.
