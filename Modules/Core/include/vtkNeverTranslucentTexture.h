/**
  \brief VTK Fix to speed up our image rendering.

  The way we render images while changing the contrast via level/window
  extremely slows down rendering.

  The cause of this slowdown is that VTK asks a texture
  (via a call to IsTranslucent) if it is translucent.
  When the texture refers to a lookup table this question
  is answered in a most expensive way: pushing every pixel
  through the lookup table to see whether it would render
  translucent.

  We can speed this up extremely by always answering NO.
  2D Image rendering in the context of MITK is still correct.

  This class is injected into the VTK system by registering
  it with vtkObjectFactory as a replacement for vtkTexture.

  We chose vtkOpenGLTexture as super class, because it seems
  that the other texture super class is deprecated:
