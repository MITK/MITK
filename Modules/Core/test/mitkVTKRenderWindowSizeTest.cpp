/**
  Check if a patch to VTK is applied as in http://paraview.org/Bug/view.php?id=14122

  Bug description from there:

  "
  After moving over to Visual Studio 2012, we found a strange problem where vtkRenderWindow GetSize()
  returns something different than what was provided to SetSize().
  Specifically, width and height are 8 pixels less than expected.
  I found a problem report which appears to describe what we are seeing. The problem goes away if we change the desktop theme to Windows Classic.
  "

  the patch from this bug should be applied to MITK's default VTK version.

  Test can be removed with VTK 6.
