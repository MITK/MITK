  \ingroup DICOMReaderModule
  \brief Flexible reader based on itk::ImageSeriesReader and GDCM, for single-slice modalities like CT, MR, PET, CR, etc.

  of its loading strategy.

  \section DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader_LoadingStrategy Loading strategy

  The set of input files is processed by a number of DICOMDatasetSorter objects which may do two sort of things:
   1. split a list of input frames into multiple lists, based on DICOM tags such as "Rows", "Columns", which cannot be mixed within a single mitk::Image
   2. sort the frames within the input lists, based on the values of DICOM tags such as "Image Position Patient"

  When the DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader is configured with DICOMDatasetSorter%s, the list of input files is processed
  as follows:
   1. build an initial set of output groups, simply by grouping all input files.
   2. for each configured DICOMDatasetSorter, process:
     - for each output group:
       1. set this group's files as input to the sorter
       2. let the sorter sort (and split)
       3. integrate the sorter's output groups with our own output groups

  \section DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader_ForcedConfiguration Forced Configuration

  In all cases, the reader will add two DICOMDatasetSorter objects that are required to load
  mitk::Images properly via itk::ImageSeriesReader:
   1. As a \b first step, the input files will be split into groups that are not compatible because they differ in essential aspects:
     - (0028,0010) Number of Rows
     - (0028,0011) Number of Columns
     - (0028,0030) Pixel Spacing
     - (0018,1164) Imager Pixel Spacing
     - (0020,0037) %Image Orientation (Patient)
     - (0018,0050) Slice Thickness
     - (0028,0008) Number of Frames
    2. As are two forced \b last steps:
      1. There will always be an instance of EquiDistantBlocksSorter,
         which ensures that there is an equal distance between all the frames of an Image.
         This is required to achieve correct geometrical positions in the mitk::Image,
         i.e. it is essential to be able to make measurements in images.
         - whether or not the distance is required to be orthogonal to the image planes is configured by SetFixTiltByShearing().
         - during this check, we need to tolerate some minor errors in documented vs. calculated image origins.
           The amount of tolerance can be adjusted by SetToleratedOriginOffset() and SetToleratedOriginOffsetToAdaptive().
           Please see EquiDistantBlocksSorter for more details. The default should be good for most cases.
      2. There is always an instance of NormalDirectionConsistencySorter,
         which makes the order of images go along the image normals (see NormalDirectionConsistencySorter)

  \section DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader_UserConfiguration User Configuration

  The user of this class can add more sorting steps (similar to the one described in above section) by calling AddSortingElement().

  Usually, an application will add sorting by "Image Position Patient", by "Instance Number", and by other relevant tags here.

  \section DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader_GantryTilt Gantry tilt handling

  When CT gantry tilt is used, the gantry plane (= X-Ray source and detector ring) and the vertical plane do not align
  anymore. This scanner feature is used for example to reduce metal artifacs (e.g. <i>Lee C , Evaluation of Using CT
  Gantry Tilt Scan on Head and Neck Cancer Patients with Dental Structure: Scans Show Less Metal Artifacts. Presented
  at: Radiological Society of North America 2011 Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting; November 27- December 2,
  2011 Chicago IL.</i>).

  The acquired planes of such CT series do not match the expectations of a orthogonal geometry in mitk::Image: if you
  stack the slices, they show a small shift along the Y axis:
\verbatim

    without tilt       with tilt

      ||||||             //////
      ||||||            //////
  --  |||||| --------- ////// -------- table orientation
      ||||||          //////
      ||||||         //////

  Stacked slices:

    without tilt       with tilt

   --------------    --------------
   --------------     --------------
   --------------      --------------
   --------------       --------------
   --------------        --------------

\endverbatim


   As such gemetries do not "work" in conjunction with mitk::Image, DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader is able to perform a correction for such series.
   Whether or not such correction should be attempted is controlled by SetFixTiltByShearing(), the default being correction.
   For details, see "Internals" below.
  \section DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader_Testing Testing

  A number of tests is implemented in module DICOMTesting, which is documented at \ref DICOMTesting.

  \section DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader_Internals Class internals

  Internally, the class is based on GDCM and it depends heavily on the gdcm::Scanner class.

  Since the sorting elements (see DICOMDatasetSorter and DICOMSortCriterion) can access tags only via the DICOMDatasetAccess interface,
  BUT DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader holds a list of more specific classes DICOMGDCMImageFrameInfo, we must convert between the two
  types sometimes. This explains the methods ToDICOMDatasetList(), FromDICOMDatasetList().

  The intermediate result of all the sorting efforts is held in m_SortingResultInProgress,
  which is modified through InternalExecuteSortingStep().

  The following diagram gives an overview of the related classes:

  \subsection DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader_TiltInternals Details about the tilt correction

  The gantry tilt "correction" algorithm fixes two errors introduced by ITK's ImageSeriesReader:
    - the plane shift that is ignored by ITK's reader is recreated by applying a shearing transformation using itk::ResampleFilter.
    - the spacing is corrected (it is calculated by ITK's reader from the distance between two origins, which is NOT the slice distance in this special case)

  Both errors are introduced in
  itkImageSeriesReader.txx (ImageSeriesReader<TOutputImage>::GenerateOutputInformation(void)), lines 176 to 245 (as of ITK 3.20)

  For the correction, we examine two consecutive slices of a series, both described as a pair (origin/orientation):
    - we calculate if the first origin is on a line along the normal of the second slice
      - if this is not the case, the geometry will not fit a normal mitk::Image/mitk::Geometry3D
      - we then project the second origin into the first slice's coordinate system to quantify the shift
      - both is done in class GantryTiltInformation with quite some comments.

  The geometry of image stacks with tilted geometries is illustrated below:
    - green: the DICOM images as described by their tags: origin as a point with the line indicating the orientation
    - red: the output of ITK ImageSeriesReader: wrong, larger spacing, no tilt
    - blue: how much a shear must correct

  \subsection DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader_Condensing Sub-classes can condense multiple blocks into a single larger block

  The sorting/splitting process described above is helpful for at least two more DICOM readers, which either try to load 3D+t images or which load diffusion data.

  In both cases, a single pixel of the mitk::Image is made up of multiple values, in one case values over time, in the other case multiple measurements of a single point.

  The specialized readers for these cases (e.g. ThreeDnTDICOMSeriesReader) can reuse most of the methods in DICOMITKSeriesGDCMReader,
  except that they need an extra step after the usual sorting, in which they can merge already grouped 3D blocks. What blocks are merged
  depends on the specialized reader's understanding of these images. To allow for such merging, a method Condense3DBlocks() is called
  as an absolute last step of AnalyzeInputFiles(). Given this, a sub-class could implement only LoadImages() and Condense3DBlocks() instead
  repeating most of AnalyzeInputFiles().
