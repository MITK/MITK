  * \brief Time stamp in milliseconds
  *
  * This class provides a timestamp in milliseconds.
  * It is a Singleton class, that internally uses a mitkRealTimeClock() for
  * time-acquisition.
  *
  * First you have to call Start() in order to set the reference-time to the current time.
  * If the user has not created and set his own "RealTimeClock", initialize() will be called and a
  * default mitkRealTimeClock() is created.
  * In addition the TimeStamp() saves a pointer to the device calling and the respective offset-time.
  * The first device will have an offset of 0, the following's offset will be the time elapsed since the
  * starting of the first device. This offset can be prompted by calling GetOffset();
  *
  * You can always get the time elapsed since calling Start() with GetElapsed(). It returns the
  * time spent in milliseconds as a double.
  *
  * When the TimeStamp is no longer used, you can call Stop(). This erases the pointer to the device
  * and the offset. When all devices have "stopped tracking" the reference-time and the current-time are reset to 0.
