  * \brief Connects a mitk::TrackingDevice to a MITK-IGT NavigationData-Filterpipeline
  *
  * This class is the source of most navigation pipelines. It encapsulates a mitk::TrackingDevice
  * and provides the position and orientation of the connected mitk::TrackingTool objects
  * as NavigationData objects. Note, that the number of outputs of TrackingDeviceSource
  * is equal to the number of tools connected to the TrackingDevice at the time
  * SetTrackingDevice() is called. If tools are added to the TrackingDevice later,
  * there will not be additional outputs in TrackingDeviceSource. You have to call
  * SetTrackingDevice() again to add the new tools as additional outputs of the filter.
  * Otherwise TrackingDeviceSource will raise an std::out_of_range exception when the filter pipeline is executed.
  * the tool number corresponds with the output number, e.g. trackingDevice-GetTool(0) is
  * the tool that will produce trackingDeviceSourceFilter->GetOutput().
  * \warning If a tool is removed from the tracking device, there will be a mismatch between
  * the outputs and the tool number!
