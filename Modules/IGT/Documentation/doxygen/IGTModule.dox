\section IGTGeneralModulePageOverview Overview

The module IGT integrates image guided therapy (IGT) functionality to MITK. The main features of MITK-IGT are: 
<ul>
  <li> handling and processing of medical imaging data which is available through MITK itself 
  <li> support of tracking devices 
  <li> a concept for processing tracking data
</ul>

MITK-IGT consists of two layers for hardware control (Tracking Layer) and processing of tracking data (Navigation Layer). Additionally it offers components for rapid development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of navigation applications. To seperate UI functionality from the rest of the code UI classes are encapsulated in the seperate module IGT-UI.
