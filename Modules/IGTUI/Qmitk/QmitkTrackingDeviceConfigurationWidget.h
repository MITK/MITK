/** Documentation:
 *   \brief An object of this class offers an UI to configurate
 *          a tracking device. If the user finished the configuration process and
 *          a fully configurated tracking device is availiabe the object emits a
 *          signal "TrackingDeviceConfigurationFinished()". You can then get the
 *          tracking device by calling the method GetTrackingDevice().
 *
 *          Once the tracking device is configurated there are two ways to reset
 *          the UI to allow the user for configuring a new device. The method Reset()
 *          can be called and there is also a button "reset" which can be pressed by
 *          the user. In both cases a signal "TrackingDeviceConfigurationReseted()"
 *          is emitted and you may wait for a new configurated tracking device.
