* method MitkRender().
* The Paint() method should be used to paint into a renderer via OpenGL-drawing commands.
* The OpenGL context matrices (GL_MODELVIEWMATRIX/GL_PROJECTIONMATRIX) are preinitialized by
* the mitkVtkPropRenderer so that the origin of the 2D-coordinate system of the 2D render
* window is located in the lower left corner and has the width and height in display pixels
* of the respective renderwindow. The x-axis is horizontally oriented, while the y-axis is
* vertically oriented. The drawing commands are directly interpreted as display coordinates.
* ApplyColorAndOpacity() can be used in the subclasses to apply color and opacity properties
* read from the PropertyList.
*
* @deprecatedSince{next_release} GLMappers are no longer supported in the rendering pipeline.
* Please use mitkVtkMapper instead or consider writing your own vtk classes, such as vtkActor
* or vtkMapper
