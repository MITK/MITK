//## @brief OpenGL-based mapper to display a spline based on a mitk::PointSet in a 2D window.
//##
/** This mapper can actually more than just draw a number of points of a
* mitk::PointSet. If you set the right properties of the mitk::DataNode,
* which contains the point set, then this mapper will also draw lines
* connecting the points, and calculate and display distances and angles
* between adjacent points. Here is a complete list of boolean properties,
* which might be of interest:
*
* - \b "show contour": Draw not only the points but also the connections between
*     them (default false)
* - \b "line width": IntProperty which gives the width of the contour lines
* - \b "show points": Wheter or not to draw the actual points (default true)
* - \b "show distances": Wheter or not to calculate and print the distance
*     between adjacent points (default false)
* - \b "show angles": Wheter or not to calculate and print the angle between
*     adjacent points (default false)
* - \b "show distant lines": When true, the mapper will also draw contour
*     lines that are far away form the current slice (default true)
* - \b "label": StringProperty with a label for this point set
