/**
 * \brief Makes the OpenCV GrabCut filter available as OpenCVImageFilter.
 *
 * Image filtering is done asynchronly by using a worker thread as GrabCut segmentation
 * can take up to some seconds. Calling the mitk::GrabCutOpenCVImageFilter::OnFilterImage()
 * method sets just the input image and wakes up the worker thread. It is not guaranteed
 * that every image gets segmented. If multiple new images where set before a segmentation
 * was finished, only the last new image gets segmented afterwards.
 *
 * At least foreground model points have to be set by
 * mitk::GrabCutOpenCVImageFilter::SetModelPoints() before a segmentation can be performed.
 * The worder thread will not be waken up before any model points were set.
 *
 * When a new segmentation is ready, mitk::GrabCutOpenCVImageFilter::GetCurrentImageId()
 * returns a new image id. The segmentation can be got then by calling
 * mitk::GrabCutOpenCVImageFilter::GetResultMask(),
 * mitk::GrabCutOpenCVImageFilter::GetResultContours() or
 * mitk::GrabCutOpenCVImageFilter::GetResultContourWithPixel().
