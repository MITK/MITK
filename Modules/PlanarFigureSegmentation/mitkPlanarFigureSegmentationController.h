* \brief This class creates a binary image from a set of PlanarFigures.
*
* The class offers a convenient way to create a binary image from a
* variable number of contours that are represented by PlanarFigures.
*
* The first step is to create a mitkSurface for each PlanarFigure.
*
* The actual segmentation is done by interpolating these surfaces
* by means of the mitkCreateDistanceImageFromSurfaceFilter.
*
* Using the vtkMarchingCubes a surface is created from the resulting
* distance-image. This surface is then turned into a binary image using the
* mitkSurfaceToImageFilter.
