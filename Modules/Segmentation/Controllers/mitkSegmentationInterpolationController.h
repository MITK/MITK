  \brief Generates interpolations of 2D slices.

  \sa QmitkSlicesInterpolator
  \sa QmitkInteractiveSegmentation

  \ingroup ToolManagerEtAl

  There is a separate page describing the general design of QmitkInteractiveSegmentation: \ref QmitkInteractiveSegmentationTechnicalPage

  This class keeps track of the contents of a 3D segmentation image.
  \attention mitk::SegmentationInterpolationController assumes that the image contains pixel values of 0 and 1.

  After you set the segmentation image using SetSegmentationVolume(), the whole image is scanned for pixels other than 0.
  SegmentationInterpolationController registers as an observer to the segmentation image, and repeats the scan whenvever the
  image is modified.

  You can prevent this (time consuming) scan if you do the changes slice-wise and send difference images to SegmentationInterpolationController.
  For this purpose SetChangedSlice() should be used. mitk::OverwriteImageFilter already does this every time it changes a
  slice of an image. There is a static method InterpolatorForImage(), which can be used to find out if there already is an interpolator
  instance for a specified image. OverwriteImageFilter uses this to get to know its interpolator.

  SegmentationInterpolationController needs to maintain some information about the image slices (in every dimension).
  This information is stored internally in m_SegmentationCountInSlice, which is basically three std::vectors (one for each dimension).
  Each item describes one image dimension, each vector item holds the count of pixels in "its" slice. This is perhaps better to understand
  from the following picture (where red items just mean to symbolize "there is some segmentation" - in reality there is an integer count).
