  /**
    \brief Generates interpolations of 2D slices.

    \sa QmitkSlicesInterpolator
    \sa QmitkInteractiveSegmentation

    \ingroup ToolManagerEtAl

    There is a separate page describing the general design of QmitkInteractiveSegmentation: \ref
    QmitkInteractiveSegmentationTechnicalPage

    This class keeps track of the contents of a 3D segmentation image.
    \attention mitk::SliceBasedInterpolationController assumes that the image contains pixel values of 0 and 1.

    After you set the segmentation image using SetSegmentationVolume(), the whole image is scanned for pixels other than
    0.
    SliceBasedInterpolationController registers as an observer to the segmentation image, and repeats the scan whenvever
    the
    image is modified.

    You can prevent this (time consuming) scan if you do the changes slice-wise and send difference images to
    SliceBasedInterpolationController.
    For this purpose SetChangedSlice() should be used. mitk::OverwriteImageFilter already does this every time it
    changes a
    slice of an image. There is a static method InterpolatorForImage(), which can be used to find out if there already
    is an interpolator
    instance for a specified image. OverwriteImageFilter uses this to get to know its interpolator.

    SliceBasedInterpolationController needs to maintain some information about the image slices (in every dimension).
    This information is stored internally in m_SegmentationCountInSlice, which is basically three std::vectors (one for
    each dimension).
    Each item describes one image dimension, each vector item holds the count of pixels in "its" slice. This is perhaps
    better to understand
    from the following picture (where red items just mean to symbolize "there is some segmentation" - in reality there
    is an integer count).
