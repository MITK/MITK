  There is a separate page describing the general design of QmitkSegmentationView: \ref QmitkSegmentationTechnicalPage

  This class creates and manages several instances of mitk::Tool.

  \li ToolManager creates instances of mitk::Tool by asking the itk::ObjectFactory to list all known implementations of mitk::Tool.
      As a result, one has to implement both a subclass of mitk::Tool and a matching subclass of itk::ObjectFactoryBase that is registered
      to the top-level itk::ObjectFactory. For an example, see mitkContourToolFactory.h. (this limitiation of one-class-one-factory is due
      to the implementation of itk::ObjectFactory).
      In MITK, the right place to register the factories to itk::ObjectFactory is the mitk::QMCoreObjectFactory or mitk::SBCoreObjectFactory.

   \li One (and only one - or none at all) of the registered tools can be activated using ActivateTool. This tool is registered to mitk::GlobalInteraction
      as a listener and will receive all mouse clicks and keyboard strokes that get into the MITK event mechanism. Tools are automatically
      unregistered from GlobalInteraction when no clients are registered to ToolManager (see RegisterClient()).

   \li ToolManager knows a set of "reference" DataNodes and a set of "working" DataNodes. The first application are segmentation tools, where the
      reference is the original image and the working data the (kind of) binary segmentation. However, ToolManager is implemented more generally, so that
      there could be other tools that work, e.g., with surfaces.

  \li Any "user/client" of ToolManager, i.e. every functionality that wants to use a tool, should call RegisterClient when the tools should be active.
      ToolManager keeps track of how many clients want it to be used, and when this count reaches zero, it unregistes the active Tool from GlobalInteraction.
      In "normal" settings, the functionality does not need to care about that if it uses a QmitkToolSelectionBox, which does exactly that when it is
      enabled/disabled.

  \li There is a set of events that are sent by ToolManager. At the moment these are TODO update documentation:
      - mitk::ToolReferenceDataChangedEvent whenever somebody calls SetReferenceData. Most of the time this actually means that the data has changed, but
        there might be cases where the same data is passed to SetReferenceData a second time, so don't rely on the assumption that something actually changed.
      - mitk::ToolSelectedEvent is sent when a (truly) different tool was activated. In reaction to this event you can ask for the active Tool using
        GetActiveTool or GetActiveToolID (where NULL or -1 indicate that NO tool is active at the moment).

  Design descisions:

  \li Not a singleton, because there could be two functionalities using tools, each one with different reference/working data.
