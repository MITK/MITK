  * via SelectInput().
  * Make sure tracking is started before proceeding any further: The filter requires tracking data from the
  * sensor to calculate the relative position of the added node.
  *
  * One can then add Nodes to the filter via AddNode(). Make sure that the node has a geometry and position set
  * in the tracking coordinate system of the reference input. The Filter will then calculate the offset between
  * Node and reference marker and continously update the node position accordign to the tracking data.
