  \ingroup BlueBerryPlugins

  \brief Provides access to Qt Help information from inside the Workbench.
  
  This plug-in collects all Qt QCH files (*.qch) from plug-ins in the RESOLVED
  state and registers them internally. The plug-in can be configured using the
  CTK Config Admin service and it listens to certain event topics on the CTK
  Event Admin.
  
  The following configuration properties for the service PID "org.blueberry.services.help"
  are supported:
  
  - \b homePage A <code>QString</code> property containing the a qthelp url pointing
                      to the applications home page.
                      
  The plug-in subscribes to the following event topics:
  
  - \b org/blueberry/help/CONTEXTHELP_REQUESTED signals a request for showing context
    sensitive help. If no properties are attached to the event, a qthelp url is constructed
    using the currently active part ID from the workbench. If the url is invalid, the
    home page is shown instead.
    <br><br>
    Supported event properties are:
      - \e url Show the given url
      
  The example below demonstrates how to provide configuration data for the
  org.blueberry.ui.qt.help plug-in.
