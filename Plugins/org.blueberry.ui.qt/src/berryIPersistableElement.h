 * When the workbench is shutdown objects which implement this interface
 * will be persisted.  At this time the <code>GetFactoryId</code> method
 * is invoked to discover the id of the element factory that will be used
 * to re-create the object from a memento.  Then the <code>SaveState</code>
 * method is invoked to store the element data into a newly created memento.
 * The resulting mementos are collected up and written out to a single file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * During workbench startup these mementos are read from the file.  The
 * factory Id for each is retrieved and mapped to an <code>IElementFactory</code>
 * which has been registered in the element factory extension point.  If a
 * factory exists for the Id it will be engaged to re-create the original
 * object.
