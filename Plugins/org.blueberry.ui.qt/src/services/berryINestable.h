 * </p>
 * A service which can appear on a component which is wholly contained with
 * another component. The component on which it appears can be active or
 * inactive -- depending on the state of the application. For example, a
 * workbench part is a component which appears within a workbench window. This
 * workbench part can either be active or inactive, depending on what the user
 * is doing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Services implement this interface, and are then notified by the component
 * when the activation changes. It is the responsibility of the component to
 * notify such services when the activation changes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is not intended for use outside of the
 * <code>org.blueberry.ui.workbench</code> plug-in.

 * <p>
 * <strong>PROVISIONAL</strong>. This class or interface has been added as part
 * of a work in progress. There is a guarantee neither that this API will work
 * nor that it will remain the same. Please do not use this API without
 * consulting with the Platform/UI team.
