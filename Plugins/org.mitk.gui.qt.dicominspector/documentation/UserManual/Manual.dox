This is a simple view that displays all DICOM properties of the data of the currently selected node.
DICOM properties are all properties that have a property name starting with "DICOM".
The plugin will show the dicom values corresponding to the currently selected time point and z slice.
E.G. the value of "acquesition time" will change with changing the time step of 3d+t image or the value
of "slice position" will change with changing the current z slice of the image.
