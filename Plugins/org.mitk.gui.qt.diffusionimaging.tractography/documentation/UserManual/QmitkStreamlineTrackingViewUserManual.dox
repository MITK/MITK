This view provides the user interface for basic streamline fiber tractography on diffusion tensor images (single and multi-tensor tracking), peak images (obtained using e.g. MITK peak extraction or MRtrix) or ODF images (Q-Balls, imorted CSD ODFs). FACT and TEND tracking methods are available.

\section StrTrackUserManualInputData Input Data

Mandatory Input:

\li One or multiple DTI Image images selected in the datamanager.
\li One peak image in MRtrix format (4D float image)

Optional Input:

\li FA image used to determine streamline termination. If no image is specified, the FA image is automatically calculated from the input tensor images. If multiple tensor images are used as input, it is recommended to provide such an FA image since the FA maps calculated from the individual input tensor images can not provide a suitable termination criterion.
\li Binary mask used to define the seed voxels. If no seed mask is specified, the whole image volume is seeded.
\li Binary mask used to constrain the generated streamlines. Streamlines can not leave the mask area.

\section StrTrackUserManualParameters Input Parameters

\li Cutoff: If the streamline reaches a position with an FA value or peak magnitude lower than the speciefied threshold, tracking is terminated.
\li Angular threshold: Maximum angle between two successive steps (in degree).
\li f and g values to balance between FACT [1] and TEND [2,3] tracking (only for tensor based tractography). For further information please refer to [2,3]
\li Step Size: The algorithm proceeds along the streamline with a fixed stepsize. Default is 0.5*minSpacing.
\li Min. Tract Length: Shorter fibers are discarded.
\li Seeds per voxel: If set to 1, the seed is defined as the voxel center. If > 1 the seeds are distributet randomly inside the voxel.

By default the image values are interpolated. Keep in mind that in the noninterpolated case, the TEND term is only applied once per voxel. In the interpolated case the TEND term is applied at each integration step which results in much higher curvatures and has to be compensated by an according choice of f and g.

Whole brain tractograms obtained with a small step size can contain billions of points. The tractograms can be compressed by removing points that do not really contribute to the fiber shape, such as many points on a straight line. An error threshold (in mm) can be defined to specify which points should be removed and which not.
