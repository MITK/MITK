          MITK Diffusion is the diffusion-weighted MR image processing application developed at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). The software is developed on the basis of the well established, free open source software toolkit MITK. It is designed to perform tasks like ODF reconstruction, fiber tractography, MR image simulation, quantification and other image processing tasks.
          <br/>
          This is a beta release based on the current master branch of MITK that features cutting edge developments and has not been tested extensively! The next stable release of this application will be based on the next stable release of MITK. Many but not all modules available in MITK are included in this beta release. If you are missing a feature we recommend to <a href="http://docs.mitk.org/nightly/BuildInstructionsPage.html">build MITK Diffusion from source</a>.
