/**
 * \ingroup org_mitk_gui_qt_welcomescreen_internal
 * \brief QmitkWelcomeScreenView
 * The WelcomeView Module is an helpful feature to people new to MITK. The main idea is to provide first
 * information about the particular working modes of the 3 M-3 application suited to specific medical working task.
 * Links to external documentation or information pages such as the mitk.org homepage are thinkable but have
 * not been implemented yet. The WelcomeView is realized by making use of the QTWebKit Module. The Qt WebKit module
 * provides an HTML browser engine that makes it easy to embed web content into native applications, and to enhance
 * web content with native controls.
 * For the welcome view of the application the QWebView, QWebPage classes have been used. The shown WelcomeView
 * html start page is styled by an external css stylesheet. The required resources as well as the html pages are integrated
 * into the QtResource system. The QT resource system allows the storage of files like html pages, css pages, jpgs etc.
 * as binaries within the executable.
 * This minimizes the risk of loosing resource files as well as the risk of getting files deleted. In order to use the Qt
 * resource system the resource files have to be added to the associated qrt resource file list.
 * Due to time issues the html pages of the welcome view do make use of jpegs with hotspots to switch
 * into the particular working modes. <
 * Nevertheless the foundation is set to design more complex html pages. The Q::WebPage gives options to set a
 * LinkDelegationPolicy. The used policy defines how links to external or internal resources are handled. To fit our needs
 * the delegate all links policy is used. This requires all external as well as internal links of the html pages to be handle
 * explicitly. In order to change mitk working modes (perspectives) a mitk url scheme has been designed. The url scheme
 * is set to mitk. The url host provides information about what's next to do. In our case, the case of switching to a
 * particular working mode the host is set to perspectives. The followed path provides information about the perspective id.
 * (e.g. mitk//::mitk.perspectives/org.mitk.qt.defaultperspective) The the generic design of the mitk url scheme allows to  * execute other task depending on the mitk url host.
