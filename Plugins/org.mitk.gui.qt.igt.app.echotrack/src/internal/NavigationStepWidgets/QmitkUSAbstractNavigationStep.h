/**
 * \brief Abstract base class for navigation step widgets.
 *
 * This class defines a life cycle for navigation steps. Steps can be activated
 * and deactivated. The first time a step is activated, it is started before
 * the activation. Steps can be stopped, finished and restarted, too.
 *
 * On every state change, the corresponding virtual On... method is called
 * (OnStartStep(), OnActivateStep(), OnFinishStep(), ...). These methods are
 * to implement by concrete navigation step widgets. While a step is in the
 * "active" state, its OnUpdate() method is called periodically.
