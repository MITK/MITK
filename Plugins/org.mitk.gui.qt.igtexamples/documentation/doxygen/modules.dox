   \brief QmitkIGTExamples shows a small typically navigation MITK functionality.

 Any kind of navigation application will start with the connection to a tracking system 
 and as we do image guided procedures we want to show something on the screen. In this
 tutorial we connect to the NDI Polaris tracking system (or alternatively use a virtual tracking device)
 and we will show the movement of a tool as cone in the render window part.
