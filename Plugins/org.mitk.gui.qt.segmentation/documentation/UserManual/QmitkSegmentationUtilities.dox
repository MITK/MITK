\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesManualOverview Overview

The <b>Segmentation Utilities View</b> allows you to postprocess existing segmentations


\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesImageSelection Image Selection

Usually the data selection in the Segmentation Utilities View is done via drop down box which let you just select the appropriate data.

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesBooleanOperations Boolean Operations

Boolean operations allow you to create the

<ul>
<li> <b>Union:</b> Combines two existing segmentations
<li> <b>Intersection:</b> Keeps just the overlapping areas of two existing segmentations
<li> <b>Difference:</b> Subtracts one segmentation from the other
</ul>

of two segmentations. The selected segmentations must have the same geometry (size, spacing, ...)

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesImageMasking Image masking

You can mask your grey value image with either an existing segmentation or a surface. The result will be an image containing only
the pixels that are cover by the respective mask.

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesMorphologicalOperators Morphological Operators

The morphological operators are applied to a single segmentation image. Based on a given structuring element the underlying segmentation will be modfied.
MITK provides a <b>ball</b> and a <b>cross</b> as structuring elements. The follow operators are at your disposal:

<ul>
<li> <b>Dilation:</b> Each labeled pixel within the segmentation will be dilated based on the selected structuring element
<li> <b>Erosion:</b> Each labeled pixel within the segmentation will be eroded based on the selected structuring element
<li> <b>Opening:</b> A dilation followed by an erosion, used for smoothing edges or eliminating small objects
<li> <b>Closing</b> An erosion followed by an dilation, used for filling small holes
<li> <b>Fill Holes</b> Fills bigger holes within a segmentation
<li> <b>Pruning</b> Removes spurs that branch off the segmentation. The radius determines the number of pruning iterations.
</ul>

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesSurfaceToImage Surface to binary image

This widget lets you fill you meshes into an empty binary image. It is required that a reference grey value image is present.
The created binary image will have the same geometrical properties like the reference image
